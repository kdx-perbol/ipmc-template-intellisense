VS intellisense &amp; type safety for Razor inRiver PIM Marketing Cloud (iPMC) HTML templates

Make your iPMC HTML Templates (e.g. In-Context Editing Templates) as Razor CSHTML Views in the project in this solution, and get intellisense and type safety when making them. Then just paste them into iPMC when you're finished (except the unnecessary bits). Also makes it easier to version control iPMC HTML Templates (possibly).
